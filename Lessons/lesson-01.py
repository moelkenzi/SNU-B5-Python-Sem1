#! Programming Structures and Operations

# 1. Sequence Structure:
# - Executes statements in order, one after another
# - The default flow of a program

# 2. Control Structures:
#   a. Decision/Conditional/Selection Structures:
#      - Used to make decisions in code based on conditions
#      - Types:
#        i.   Single alternative: Uses only 'if' (e.g., if condition: do_something())
#        ii.  Dual alternative: Uses 'if' and 'else' (e.g., if condition: do_this() else: do_that())
#        iii. Nested if: 'if' statements inside other 'if' statements

#   b. Loop / Iteration:
#      - Repeats a block of code multiple times
#      - Common types: for loops, while loops

# 3. Arithmetic Operations:
# - Mathematical calculations (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
# - Example: addition (2 + 2 = 4), multiplication (3 * 4 = 12)

# 4. Relational Operations:
# - Compare values (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
# - Example: is 5 greater than 3? (5 > 3) is True

# 5. Logical Operations:
# - Combine or modify boolean values (and, or, not)
# - Example: (True and False) is False, (True or False) is True

# These concepts form the foundation of programming logic and control flow

# Let's dive deeper into each of these concepts:

# 1. Sequence Structure:
# - This is the most basic programming structure
# - Code is executed line by line, from top to bottom
# - Example:
#   x = 5
#   y = 10
#   z = x + y
#   print(z)  # Output: 15

# 2. Control Structures:
#   a. Decision Structures:
#      - Allow the program to make choices based on conditions
#      - Example of nested if:
#        if x > 0:
#            if y > 0:
#                print("Both x and y are positive")
#            else:
#                print("Only x is positive")
#        else:
#            print("x is not positive")

#   b. Loop Structures:
#      - Allow repetition of code blocks
#      - For loop example:
#        for i in range(5):
#            print(i)  # Prints numbers 0 to 4
#      - While loop example:
#        count = 0
#        while count < 5:
#            print(count)
#            count += 1

# 3. Arithmetic Operations:
# - More examples:
#   - Subtraction: 10 - 3 = 7
#   - Division: 15 / 3 = 5.0 (float division)
#   - Floor Division: 15 // 2 = 7 (integer division, rounds down)
#   - Modulus: 17 % 5 = 2 (remainder of division)
#   - Exponentiation: 2 ** 3 = 8 (2 to the power of 3)

# 4. Relational Operations:
# - Used in conditional statements and loops
# - More examples:
#   - Not equal to: 5 != 3 is True
#   - Less than or equal to: 4 <= 4 is True
#   - Greater than: 7 > 10 is False

# 5. Logical Operations:
# - Used to combine multiple conditions
# - More examples:
#   - not True is False
#   - (5 > 3) and (10 < 20) is True
#   - (5 > 7) or (3 < 2) is False

# Understanding these structures and operations is crucial for writing
# efficient and logical programs in any programming language.
